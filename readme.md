## Installation 

### üì¶„ÉªManually compiling GPT
1. Start off by installing [python](https://www.python.org/) üêç
2. Run `setup.bat`
3. `GPT.exe` will now be located in `./output`

**or**

1. Start off by installing [python](https://www.python.org/) üêç
2. Open your terminal
3. Navigate to the directory where you have the source code
4. Run `pip install -r requierments.txt` *or* run `pip install <module>` for every module in `requierments.txt`
5. Run `pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --console --icon "NONE" --name "GPT" --add-data "./functions;functions/" --add-data "./main.ini;." "./main.py"`\*
6. Wait... üí§
7. Delete the folder called `build` and the file called `GPT.spec`\*\*
8. `GPT.exe` will now be located in `./output`
9. Give yourself a well deserved pat on the back. You just compiled a python program! üéâ


\* *(Feel free to mess around with the params for the `pyinstaller` call. Altough `--onefile` and `--console` are needed for GPT to function)* 

\*\* *(If you changed the `--name` param then the `.spec` file will have a diffrent name)*



### üñ•Ô∏è„ÉªBeing able to run it from your terminal
1. Open your windows search bar and type `Edit the system environment variables`
2. Click on `Enviroment Variables...` in the bottom right corner
3. On the lower half of the window scroll down untill you see `Path` on the left side of the table
4. Double Click `Path`
5. Place `GPT.exe` in one of those folders **or** Place `GPT.exe` wherever you want, then add that directory to Path by clicking `New` in the top right corner of the window\*
6. Open your terminal an run `gpt`, `GPT`, `gpt.exe` or `GPT.exe`

\* *(Don't place `GPT.exe` inside of `C:\windows\system32`. It's bad practise and can lead to problems down the line)*
